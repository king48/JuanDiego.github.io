      Recursion is one of the most complex ideas that we've done in this course, however, it is one of 
      the most useful and once you got the hang of it, its not too difficult. Recursion is based off of 
      having a base case. What recursion does is it is given some starting values, the method begins to call 
      itself but it doesn't necessarily know  
      where its going but it does know its getting closer to the base case. So for example, with ages, a 
      Joe may know they're only 2 years older than Oliver - if Oliver is 6 then logically, Joe is 
      8 years old. In this case Oliver was the base case the value that we knew and that decides the values before 
      it. When it reaches the base case it can then backtrack and determine the values of the things it skipped over. 
      If this explanation isn't good enough please look at the example below.

      You should avoid recursion at all costs if it does not significantly simplify your solution. 
      For example in merge sort it is very useful, but for counting a number it may not be. Avoid 
      recursion when it involves large local arrays, because this can cause a memory overflow. Remember 
      recursion is best used for traversing directories, some sorting algorithms such as divide and conquer 
      algorithms and merge sort. Unless you're doing things like these be it may be best to use an Iterative
      solution that can end up using less memory, being more efficient and overall easier to write.

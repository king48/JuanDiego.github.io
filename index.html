    <h2 class="headers">Who am I?</h2>
    <p class="text_column">My name is Juan Diego Castano Luna, and I’m a very proud Canadian-Colombian. I came to Canada when I was two year old
    and haven't looked back because the opportunities provided here have simply been amazing. Cadets has been a great
    opportunity, I’ve been a cadet since I was nine years old, and just recently started my paperwork to join the Royal
    Canadian Reserves. I've also been in the workforce since grade ten, working downtown as a Water Taxi driver, and yes, I
    have all my licences. I’ve always been interested in programming because of the endless number of things that can be
    done with it -- being able to create something that you thought up in your head and making it a reality has always
    fascinated me. This is one of the reasons I have been inclined to engineering, design and programming. These three
    pillars are something I want to integrate into my future career and are things that will hopefully make me an
    indispensable member of a team one day.
    </p>
    <p class="text_column">
    Here's a little back story starting with grade ten. I started working with Arduinos in grade ten, and integrating it
    with 3D printed designs I created at home with Autocad and Solidworks. Creating a program, integrating the hardware and
    then designing the part required a lot of problem solving skills and a lot of late nights, however, the things I learnt
    have been priceless. I am a strong believer of learning from your mistakes and this is what these projects provided me
    with a place to explore my capabilities and a place to expand my knowledge. Another area of interest I have is finance,
    how can someone practically create a thing that solves a specific issue without having good financial literacy? I have
    begun investing in stocks - and yes, of course - ethereum which is a very advanced decentralized currency that
    integrates decentralized applications -- a topic of great interest to me. Programming is a very important pillar to
    ethereum and fintech, and if you havent noticed its a very important part of my life.
    </p>
    <h2 class="headers">Portfolio Topics</h2>
    <p class="text">
       In my portfolio owe will be talking about everything we've gone over in this course to prepare us for 
       our AP Exam. We will start discussing Object Oriented Programming,along with Arrays and ArrayLists, and Recursion. 
       Please enjoy the work that I have presented here in my portfolio and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

                                The analogy of this tutorial is simple: think of a java programmer as a
                                <br/>
                                writer, composing a Spongebob Episode. All of the characters and settings are
                                <br/>
                                "off-the-shelf", and need to only be modified slightly to fit into a new
                                <br/>
                                episode. All that's left to write is a script for a plot that
                                <br/>
                                pulls all those pre-existing elements together.

                                That, in a nutshell, is java programming. Think of it as Dean Koontz

                Meet Mr. Squarepants, Mr. Squarepants lives a life underwater. His TV show is a documentary
                <br/>
                about his life as a fry cook underwater. Spongebob's viewers are never disappointed because his 
                <br/>
                shows when watched back to back appear as one continuous episode. How does he manage this?
            </P>
            <P>
                Well, before Spongebob's creators produce anything, they first write their ideas down at their 
                <br/>
                desks, sweep aside the empty 5 hour energy bottles. It is on this single page which they will plan 
                <br/>
                Spongebob's whole life.
            </P>
            <P>
                How can Spongebob's creators get the whole story onto only one page? Simple -  everything 
                <br/>
                they produce onto the page is simply a series of events or plots. Setting, character 
                <br/>
                development, and how the characters interact is all taken care of elsewhere. How do they do
                <br/>
                that? Let's find out.
            </P>
            <P>
                You see, Spongebob's creators, more than anything else, are very consistent in the TV show. It's 
                <br/>
                what has made it so popular. Let's say that they have sat down to produce their hundredth 
                <br/>
                episode.
            </P>
            <P>
                The first thing that the producers need is a setting, so they dust off an old binder they have 
                <br/>

                    them it makes sense. The first line states that they are defining an UnderwaterTown. Notice that

                    they do not use a space between the words. This is because they fear that a space may confuse

                        Finally, you may have noticed that whenever the producers want to group a particular set of 
                        <br/>
                        statements, they will use curly brackets, "{". Even though they all know their characters well, 
                        <br/>
                        this lets them quickly see where statements begin and end. Any <B> class </B> will always end with all 
                        <br/>
                        the open curly braces being closed.

                        If the producers do create (<B>instantiate</B>) Bikini Bottom (<B>object</B>) eventually in their TV show, their 
                        <br/>
                        artists will look to the same Underwater Town <B>class </B> to determine what that town should look

                        So now, we've sneaked a peek at the producers' binders. They have reviewed the Underwater

                        Town section and think that this episode should take place in an underwater town. Now they

                    The publishers have a strange way of saying things, don't they? It would be possible to explain

                    what each word in those first two lines do, but it wouldn't make much sense to you at this

                    <br/>
                    is that that line is how the producers let their artists know that this piece of paper is the <B> main 
                    <br/>
                    routine </B>, or plot.

                    <br/>
                    that BikiniBottom is an object of UnderwaterTown) Followed by a period then by the name of 
                    <br/>
                    the <B>variable</B>. Having done this, the publishers can then provide a value for the variables such as 2

                    So, believe it or not, you've just seen object-oriented programming in action. Our publishers 
                    <br/>
                    have first created the class (that was the binder) that created a general definition of what an 
                    <br/>
                    UnderwaterTown was, the producers then turned to their <B> main </B> layer and created 
                    <br/>
                    (<B>instantiated</B>) an UnderwaterTown <B>object</B> which they called BikiniBottom.

                <P>
                    Now, for the grandma, the producers need a different binder. So they put "UnderwaterTown" 
                    <br/>
                    back on the shelf, and go to pick up a new binder. They pass over many different titles, like 
                    <br/>
                    "Pets", "Restaurants", "Weather", "Music", all the essentials for a good Spongebob episode, until
                    <br/>
                    they finally come to the binder they want: "Sponges". They open up to the introduction:

                    <br/>
                    change their values  for different characters later in the story. You'll note that they left out the

                    sex, name, and memorable shape as no two sponges are completely alike. The publishers prefer

                    to specify those variables when they  write the plot.

                    We have introduced here the idea of subclasses. "Sponges"; was a class, and "SpongeGrandma"

                    a subclass of it.

                    You may also be wondering why the publishers declared "Sponges grandChildren" in this

                    subclass. Think of it this way, if the grandma is going to have grandchildren visit her, the artists 
                    <br/>
                    have to know what a grandchild is. By declaring "Sponges grandChildren", her editor will know 
                    <br/>
                    that a grandchild is a type of sponge.

                    how their characters act, the publishers can create quite a bit of character development without

                    Although the publishers used quite a few strange symbols, their approach was straightforward 
                    <br/>
                    and consistent. The first thing that they did was naming the method "knitSweaters". Since the 
                    <br/>
                    method name is knitSweaters, the publishers figure that they should modify the grandma's 
                    <br/>
                    number of sweaters knit, in this case by adding one to it. That is what the "++" after 
                    <br/>
                    "numberOfSweatersKnit" does.

                    Now, the grandmas in the producers' tv shows are famous for being able to knit sweaters. 
                    <br/>
                    Hence, it's very difficult to see exactly how many sweaters the grandma has knit in her large 
                    <br/>
                    stack. The publishers decide that it's a good idea to allow their grandma to state how many 
                    <br/>
                    sweaters she has knit, so, they write a new method:

                    the name of the method. Remember, their artists don't like surprises, and if they didn't tell the 
                    <br/>
                    artists what sort of variable this method was going to return, they'd get all hot and flustered.

                    knit sweaters. However, just to make for a good closing, the publishers decide to have the 
                    <br/>
                    grandchildren visit the grandma. They set out to write one more method. What makes this 
                    <br/>
                    different than the other methods is that it needs information about someone other than the 
                    <br/>
                    grandma, namely the grandchild that is visiting. To allow for flexibility  (and a variety of 
                    <br/>
                    grandchildren), the publishers decide to leave the identity of the grandchild blank for now.

                    certain things as variables to be specified only when the plot is written. And by writing that the

                    "Geez! I should have stayed with the green type," you're probably saying to yourself. Don't 
                    <br/>
                    worry. It looks much more than it is, and you probably understand most of it already. First, we 
                    <br/>
                    have the name of the method: "visitGrandma". No surprise there. Then, between those 
                    <br/>
                    parenthesis, we have "Sponge grandChild". What comes between those parenthesis is called an 
                    <br/>
                    argument. It helps make the method more specific. When the publishers start writing their, plot, 
                    <br/>
                    they will at some point want the grandchild to visit the grandma. But if they just write in the 
                    <br/>
                    plot "grandma.visitGrandma()", that wouldn't be very exciting for the viewer. Who has visited? 
                    <br/>
                    What was their name? Priding themselves on always having strong characters, the publishers 
                    <br/>
                    wants to add the name of the grandchild who is visiting. Hence, when their plot says 
                    <br/>
                    "visitGrandma", it will also say the name of the grandchild that is visiting as an argument. 
                    <br/>
                    "Sponges", which comes before "grandma", tells the artist that the thing visiting is a sponge. The
                    <br/>
                    artists don't like surprises, so knowing that it is a sponge visiting, rather than say, plankton, 
                    <br/>
                    reduces the guesswork on their hands.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The next line is another attempt by the publishers to please their artists, who are being even 
                    <br/>
                    more picky than ever! Even though they have supplied the name of the grandchild as an 
                    <br/>
                    argument, their artists won't let them use it in the method until they have stated that the 
                    <br/>
                    "grandchild" that she declared as a "grandma" variable is equal to the vale given in the 
                    <br/>
                    method's argument.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Having finally jumped through all of their artists' hoops (don't expect to understand all of that 
                    <br/>
                    right away, it took the publishers a couple of weeks!), the publishers get down to finishing the 
                    <br/>
                    rest of their method. Once the grandchild has visited the grandma, the variable 
                    <br/>
                    "grandChildrenVisited" will surely go up by one, so the producers put the same "++" after 
                    <br/>
                    grandChildVisited that they had put after "numberOfSweatersKnit" in the "knitSweaters" method.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The stage being set, the publishers decide that it is time to let their readers know what is going 
                    <br/>
                    on. Hence the "system.out.println" statement. A bit wordy, but it let's their artists know that 
                    <br/>
                    what comes between those parentheses goes into the final plot of the episode: all the text they 
                    <br/>
                    put in between quotation marks. Why is the variable 'grandchild.identifyName()' then not in 
                    <br/>
                    quotation marks? Because it is not a literal, but rather an object's method. By keeping it out of 
                    <br/>
                    the quotation marks, the publisher lets their artists know that they have to for look for the 
                    <br/>
                    grandchild object (they would find out that it was of the "Sponges" class) then for the method 
                    <br/>
                    "identifyName" (they would see that it returned the grandchild's name). All of that for a 
                    <br/>
                    grandchild's name!
                </P>
                <P>
                    Had they put grandChild.identifyName() inside of the quotation marks, their artists would have 
                    <br/>
                    drawn out the words in the final copy of the episode: "Oh golly grandChild.identifyName () has 
                    <br/>
                    visited the my old soul!". In order for their artists to substitute the variable name for the word
                    <br/>
                    name, the publishers close the quotation marks before they write it. The "+" lets the artists  
                    <br/>
                    know that the publishers want them to join the two statements.

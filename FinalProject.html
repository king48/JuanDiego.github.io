    <h2 class="headers-moved">The Anxious Life of Alex Jo</h2>
    <p class="text">This is our final project for AP ICS. We worked on this project over a series of 5 weeks and developed a pretty fun and
    intuitive have for people from ages 16+ who suffer from social anxiety. We choose to do social anxiety because of the
    sheer amount of people it affects and the very little awareness around the topic. Overall the game teaches the player
    techniques that will help them deal with the disorder accordingly. We are very proud of our with and hope that you enjoy
    playing the game as much as we enjoyed making it.

    <h2 class="headers">The Daily Struggle of Living with SAD</h2>
    <p class="text">
This is Alex, he suffers from SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder). Alex has many struggles, mainly school
struggles. Alex can't put itself in diverse social situations. For example public speaking, or telling
the barber it doesn't like his haircut. It is very difficult for Alex to stand up for itself, in fact
if someone is saying something unjust about them and puts them on the spot odds are Alex will bite his tongue
nod his head and apologize. Panic attacks and Anxiety attacks are the worst for Alex though. A panic attack 
is simple, we all have them, put yourself in a situation to panic and you will. forget your pencil case before a test, you will 
have a panic attack, remember you left the stove on, you will have a panic attack. Usually simply rectifying the situation 
and or removing yourself from the situation is enough to calm a panic attack. However, anxiety attacks are much 
much worse. This is when you have a panic attack on a much greater scale, one that the average joe on the street likely hasn't 
experienced in their lives. Removing yourself from the situation doesn't solve an anxiety attack and they don't go away in minutes but it could take hours. 
The worst part is the solution for an anxiety attack is different for everyone, some people find comfort in 
saying the phonetic alphabet backwards, others like slime or good comforting odors. But even when you do find 
that thing that makes the situation more bearable anxiety attacks can result in passing out and long term stress 
which can lead to other medical issues in the long run.  

 As you could probably see he lives a very difficult life and its one that a 'regular person'
will find hard to understand. But for over 16 million people in North America this is their reality, with most of
those people being between the ages of 16 and over.

    <p class="text">
      Arrays have given rise to a whole area of interest that has to do with traversing an array in an efficient way in order
    to find, classify and order data in a certain way. For example from smallest to greatest or in alphabetical order. The
    way we do this is using algorithms whose sole purpose is to sort an array, there are a whole host of different sorting
    algorithms that are all used in different situations with different efficiencies.

    <h2 class="headers">Bubble Sort</h2>
    <p class="text">
      My first example is bubble sort one of
    the most common sorts because of its simplicity. Put simply it compares two elements in an array, if a condition is met
    one or the other is passed on to be compared to the next element. This is done until the end of the array where it does
    this again. However, this sorting algorithm is really only good for smaller arrays and even then its questionable.

    <h2 class="headers">Merge Sort</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Merge sort different from bubble sort because it uses a lot less comparisons when it is scaled up. Merge sort generally
      uses recursion but it can be done without recursion. It begins with continuously splitting an array in half until we are
      left with individual elements. When the elements are on their own we examine and compare elements next to one another
      and place them into their own arrays. We then merge the arrays that were just created and continue to compare until we
      are left with just one array. It is one of the most complex sorting algorithms, however, it is one of the most efficient
      when it comes to larger arrays.

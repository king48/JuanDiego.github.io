    <h2 class="headers">What is Inheritance?</h2>
    <p class="text">
    Using inheritance we can define a relationship between one more more objects. Its as simple as us inheriting our basic
    traits and characteristics from our parents but in this case we are inheriting it from one parent, and the traits and
    characteristics are passed exactly how they were written - although, that can be changed by overriding methods. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="headers">Superclasses and Subclasses</h2>
    <p class="text">
      All objects can be defined using a superclass which outlines basic attributes and behaviours of an object, these will
      get passed down to all the subclasses that extend the superclass. For example, all humans have 4 limbs, 10 fingers and
      10 toes, but as we begin talking about things that are more specific details there are many different types of
      humans(Cockaisians, Asians, African-Americans) with little differences in characteristics and behaviours. In this case
      we can say an Asian is-a human, this one way we can show the relationship between classes. We will get more in depth
      into how to implement inheritance in the next section.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="headers">Upcasting and Downcasting </h2>
    <p class="text_column">
      With upcasting and downcasting we can use the relationships we previously established to our advantage. When you are
      upcasting essentially what you are doing is casting to a subtype, this is done automatically and isn't too difficult.
      Why would anyone use this? Itâ€™s done to treat a subclass as a superclass type, for example, a Camera is a Machine, we can
      for a split moment label the camera as the machine that it is.<br>
      <b class="codeFont">Camera c = new Camera (); <br></b>
      <b class="codeFont"> Machine m = c; <br> </b>
      <b class="codeFont"> // this is an example of upcasting <br></b>
      Things can't really fail when upcasting, however, downcasting becomes more complicated.   
      </p>
<p class="text_column">
      Let's say we want to label the machine as a camera that would work. However, where
      it could fail is when we want to label the camera as a television. A television is a machine but it is not a camera, if
      this is done you will get an error. Its important to explicitly state (Camera) in order to successfully downcast.
      <b class="codeFont">Camera c = new Camera (); <br></b>
      <b class="codeFont"> Machine m = new Machine (); <br> </b>
      <b class="codeFont"> Camera c2 = (Camera) m;<br></b>
      One last thing I must mention about upcasting and downcasting, an object will lose
      all its properties inherited below its position. So for example if you consider a phone to be a camera, and cast a phone
      to be a machine it will lose its phone and camera properties.

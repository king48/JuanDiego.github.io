    <h2 class="headers">Arrays</h2>
    <p class="text_column">
      An Array is data structure that very useful for storing large amounts of data of the same type in an easy to access way. Keep in mind an 
      array is not a primitve data type,  it is an object. This is why it is declared by saying: <b><i>type</i>[] name = new <i>type</i> [SIZE]</b>
      - here we are creating a new array object, bear in mind the size is always a constant. We can also initalize an array by saying: <b><i>type</i> [] name = {data, data,...}</b>. This is 
      an easy way to initalize an array with preset values. One thing to keep in mind about arrays is that if you try to access 
      an element in an array that is greater than the set size you will get an error. 
    </p>
    <p class="text_column">
      Arrays are unique in that they have some confusing syntax. First and foremost arrays start at zero, but when 
      you want to get the length of an array not only do you have to remmeber there are no brackets - arr.length - but that the 
      value returned is the number of elements. So in an array with ten elements you can only go from 0 - 9, but this method will
      output 10, therefore, when you want to use it in your program to refrence the final element in an array 
      you must do arr.length - 1. Now, how can we use that length? We can traverse though an array using a for loop. 
      All that has to be done is:<b> for (int a = 0; a < arr.length - 1; a ++)</b>

    We can think of two dimensional arrays as simply two 1D arrays, with one being the rows and the other being the columns.
    A two dimensional array declared like so:<b> <i>type</i>[][] name = new <i>type</i> [SIZE1][SIZE2];</b>  it can also be declared like so:
    <b> <i>type</i> [][] name = {{data,..},{data,..}} </b>. When attempting to access an element in an array we need to specify the element
    we would like to access with both the rows and columns. Two dimensional arrays are very useful when working with mazes,
    grids etc.
  </p>
  <h2 class="headers">ArrayLists </h2>
  <p class = "text">
    ArrayLists are a very useful type of array that uses different methods in order to add, remove and manipulate an
    array during runtime. An array list starts off with a size of ten even when not specified and then doubles everytime
    it needs more space in the array, this cannot be done in a conventional array and is a big advantage of using an
    arraylist.This is how an arraylist is declared: <b>ArrayList <<i>type</i>> name = new ArrayList <<i>type</i>>() </b>. 
    Array lists have a number of different methods, when using them always put the name of the arraylist first and then the 
    method overloaded with something. <b>arrList.get(index)</b>. The most common methods are get, set, add and remove. All 
    of these methods can be overloaded and they will return a curtain value.
